# SNIC superpixels

This repository offers the code for the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm with a Python interface. One can produce superpixels for grey, color, as well as images with any other number of channels. A demo file is provided, which should be easy to use. When using for the first time, the C files need to be compiled using:
```
python compile_snic_lib.py
```

The demo can then be run using:
```
python SNICDemo.py
```
The output of the demo should be as follows:
